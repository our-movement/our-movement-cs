      <section>
        <p><span class="newthought">Our Movement</span> aims to promote radical social change by catalyzing the emergence of resilient societies. It is dedicated towards reclaiming, expanding and enriching the commons by producing a wide variety of free and open-source software that benefits the whole of humanity and the substrate we depend upon.</p>
        <p>The movement's principal focus is to help transcend the current socioeconomic system that is rapidly debasing the planetary life support system, thus putting humanity on self-terminating trajectory. Specifically, building tools so communities are able to transcend their governance and economics.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Although the movement is still in its infancy stage, it is already engaged in developing the first project called <a href="https://our-funding.org/" target="_blank">Our Funding</a>—which is an all-encompassing, distributed & global crowdfunding platform.

        <h2>Funding</h2>
        <p>Funding for the movement will come from a few platforms that generate economic activity as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy" target="_blank">sharing economy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>. These platforms utilize <i>‘<1% Transaction Fee’</i> business model<label for="funding" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input id="funding" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">this is a temporary measure and the transaction fees will be dropped once the movement becomes sustainable through donations—fully embracing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a></span>, and are wholly owned by a non-profit organization called <a href="https://our-foundation.org/" target="_blank">Our Foundation</a>—which exists solely as a mechanism to institutionally support the movement. Those funds are then used to also develop other projects that don't have a business model.</p>
